Quirks is a universal wallet adapter that makes it easy to connect your dApps
to existing wallets in the Cosmos blockchains ecosystem.

It was born with the idea of: **‚ÄúWrite once, use everywhere‚Äù**.

## Why

We are not fully satisfied with some aspects of the current state of the art
for the libraries that allow the connection between dApps and wallets.
In particular, we do not like:

1. Too many dependencies to import, which has a significant impact on the
   weight of the final application
2. Enforcement of the use of specific frameworks/libraries (such as React)
3. This enforcement also requires that wallet access is only available through
   specific patterns that are strictly dependent on the particular libraries or
   frameworks used (such as hooks). Rather, we want to use them as if they were
   services, responding to requests as simply as writing promises
4. No support for native mobile development, with many difficulties in
   developing native dApps

**These are the reasons for the birth of Quirks, and what the library is here
to solve.**

Moreover, we want to introduce the concept of universal dApps: **what about
sharing the same code among web and mobile dApps**?

It is a very hot topic in the developer community. So while there's a lot of
work to be done and there may be pitfalls in such an exchange at the moment,
having a library designed to run on different frameworks and mobile devices
would be a catalyst for the development of universal dApps, allowing the
Cosmos audience to be extended to mobile users.

## Quirks solution

These are the basic parts and principles that we kept in mind while developing
Quirks:

1. Framework agnostic (Currently providing support for React and Vue 3; more
   to come in the next future)
2. SSR support (Through NextJS and NuxtJS)
3. WalletConnect support
4. Mobile development support (React Native)
5. Tiny Bundle impact (Using dynamic import through vendor chunk splitting):
   **We only load the resources when needed üôÉ**
6. Improve Developer eXperience
