title: Hooks
---

Quirks provides several useful hooks for integrating the library and its
functionality within your vue codebase.

## useConnect

Provides the methods and information required to use the wallets, connect to them, and obtain status information about the connection.

```ts twoslash
import { useConnect } from "@quirks/vue";

const {
  connect,
  disconnect,
  status,
  setupStatus,
  connected,
  connecting,
  disconnected,
  connectionError,
  rejected,
  wallet,
  walletName,
} = useConnect();
```

## useChain

Provides information about the previously configured chain, along with the address for that wallet/chain pair if the wallet is connected.

<Callout title="Note">
  The list of supported chains depends on the wallet you are using; not all
  wallets allow you to add custom chains. Therefore, it may not be possible to
  get information for some chains.
</Callout>

```ts twoslash
import { useChain } from "@quirks/vue";

/**
 * The name of the chain for which you want to obtain
 * information corresponds to the one you have configured in the Config object.
 */
const chainName = "osmosis";

const {
  chain,
  assetsList,
  address,
  accountName,
  getOfflineSigner,
  getOfflineSignerOnlyAmino,
  getOfflineSignerAuto,
  signAmino,
  signDirect,
} = useChain(chainName);
```

## useChains

Provides information about all connected chains, along with the address for those wallet/chain pairs if the wallet is connected.

<Callout title="Note">
  The list of supported chains depends on the wallet you are using; not all
  wallets allow you to add custom chains. Therefore, it may not be possible to
  get information for some chains.
</Callout>

```ts twoslash
import { useChains } from "@quirks/vue";

const { accounts, accountName, getAddresses, getAddress, getChain } =
  useChains();
```

## useConfig

Returns information about the configuration of Quirks previously defined in the
[Config object](/docs/config).

```ts twoslash
import { useConfig } from "@quirks/vue";

const { wallets, chains, assetsLists } = useConfig();
```

## useWalletConnect

Provides information about WalletConnect connection, including the
**pairing URI** if connecting to a wallet that supports it.

```ts twoslash
import { useWalletConnect } from "@quirks/vue";

const { pairingURI, namespaces, providerOpts } = useWalletConnect();
```

## useWalletEvents

A utility that allows you to subscribe to Quirks events to perform custom actions.

```ts twoslash
import { useWalletEvents } from "@quirks/vue";

const { flush } = useWalletEvents("accountsChanged", () => {
  //                                 ^|
  // your custom code
});
```
