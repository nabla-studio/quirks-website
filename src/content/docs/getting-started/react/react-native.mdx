title: React Native
---

If you want to use Quirks on React Native, after completing the basic installation process outlined [here](./installation.md), you will need to follow these steps to get started.

## Installation

```package-install
@quirks/react-native
```

You will also need some additional packages to help with storage and polyfills:

```package-install
@craftzdog/react-native-buffer react-native-get-random-values react-native-quick-crypto @react-native-community/netinfo @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
```

If you are using our default configuration, you will also need:

```package-install
react-native-mmkv
```

<Callout type="warn">
  If you are using version v1 of yarn you must manually install the peer
  dependencies, as this version of yarn does not automatically resolve them.
</Callout>

## Setup

Add the Quirks setup import to your `index.ts` or `App.tsx`.
It must be included in a boot file to ensure that dependencies are
correctly imported.

```ts title="index.ts"
import "@quirks/react-native/setup";
```

Add babel preset:

```js title="babel.config.js"
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: [..., '@quirks/react-native/babel'],
  };
};
```

## Generate config

The `generateConfig` utility simplifies integration with React Native by automatically creating a setup with all the basic configurations for RN. This setup is optional and can be customized if needed.

```tsx twoslash title="App.tsx"
import { generateConfig } from "@quirks/react-native";
import { keplrMobile, leapMobile } from "@quirks/wallets";
import { osmosis, osmosisAssetList } from "@nabla-studio/chain-registry";
import { QuirksConfig } from "@quirks/react";
// ---cut-start---
import * as React from "react";
// ---cut-end---

const config = generateConfig({
  wallets: [keplrMobile, leapMobile],
  chains: [osmosis],
  assetsLists: [osmosisAssetList],
  walletConnectOptions: {
    providerOpts: {
      logger: "info",
      projectId: process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_WC_PROJECT_ID,
      metadata: {
        name: "Quirks Demo",
        description: "Quirks universal dApp demo",
        url: "https://www.quirks.nabla.studio/",
        icons: ["https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37784886"],
      },
    },
  },
});

/**
 * Your app entry point
 */
function App() {
  return <QuirksConfig config={config}></QuirksConfig>;
}

export default App;
```

## Android Fix

There is currently a bug in the **react-native-quick-crypto** library ([which has been recently fixed](https://github.com/margelo/react-native-quick-crypto/commit/8d4bbcdee28220508a770e050201737ca903e6d9#diff-197b190e4a3512994d2cebed8aff5479ff88e136b8cc7a4b148ec9c3945bd65aR103) but not yet released in a new build). To address this issue, you need to import the following configuration into your `build.gradle`.

```bash title="android/app/build.gradle"
android {
    ...
    packagingOptions {
        pickFirst 'lib/x86/libcrypto.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/x86_64/libcrypto.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/armeabi-v7a/libcrypto.so'
        pickFirst 'lib/arm64-v8a/libcrypto.so'
    }
}
```
