title: Next.js - React Server Component
---

Thanks to the use of [cookies](/docs/getting-started/react/ssr-with-cookies), it is possible to support the use of [RSCs](https://vercel.com/blog/understanding-react-server-components), and several utilities are available to facilitate their integration using the App router.

## getConnect

Returns information about the current wallet and about the status of the connection.

```ts twoslash
import { getConnect } from "@quirks/next";

const {
  status,
  setupStatus,
  connected,
  connecting,
  disconnected,
  connectionError,
  rejected,
  walletName
} = getConnect();
```

## getChain

If you use the name of a previously configured chain as parameter, it will 
return information about that chain. If the wallet is connected, it will also 
return the address for that wallet/chain pair.

<Callout title="Note">
The list of supported chains depends on the wallet you are using; not all 
wallets allow you to add custom chains. Therefore, it may not be possible to 
get information for some chains.
</Callout>

```ts twoslash
import { getChain } from "@quirks/next";

/**
 * The name of the chain for which you want to obtain information
 * corresponds to the one you have used in the Config object.
 */
const chainName = "osmosis";

const {
  address,
  accountName,
} = getChain(chainName);
```

## getChains

Returns information about all connected chains. If the wallet is connected, 
it will also return the address for that wallet/chain pairs.

```ts twoslash
import { getChains } from "@quirks/next";

const {
  accounts,
  accountName,
  getAddresses,
  getAddress
} = getChains();
```

## Example

```tsx twoslash title="/app/server-component-example.tsx"
import { getConnect, getChain } from "@quirks/next";
// ---cut-start---
import * as React from "react";
// ---cut-end---

export const ServerComponentExample = () => {
  const { connected } = getConnect();
  const { address } = getChain('osmosis');

  if (!connected) {
    return <div>Disconnected</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      Server Component
      <div>Chain Name: Osmosis</div>
      <div>Address: {address}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```
