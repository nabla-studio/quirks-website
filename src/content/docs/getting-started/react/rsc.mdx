title: Next.js - React Server Component
---

By using [cookies](/docs/getting-started/react/ssr-with-cookies), supporting [RSCs](https://vercel.com/blog/understanding-react-server-components) becomes possible, and there are various utilities available to ease their integration with the App router.

<Callout type="warn" title="Notice">
  This functionality requires a version of @quirks/store >= 0.25.0
</Callout>

## Retrieve quirks cookie state

All the following utilities requires you to pass a raw cookie string to them,
so then they'll be able to parse it and return you to correct state result.

For example using nextjs you can retrieve by doing this:

```ts
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';

const getQuirksState = async () => {
  const results = await cookies();
  const quirks = results.get('quirks');

  return quirks?.value;
}
```

### getConnect

Returns information about the current wallet and about the status of the connection.

```ts twoslash
import { getConnect } from "@quirks/ssr";

// ---cut-start---
const quirksRawCookie = '';
// ---cut-end---

const {
  status,
  setupStatus,
  connected,
  connecting,
  disconnected,
  connectionError,
  rejected,
  walletName,
} = getConnect(quirksRawCookie);
```

### getChain

If you use the name of a previously configured chain as parameter, it will
return information about that chain. If the wallet is connected, it will also
return the address for that wallet/chain pair.

<Callout title="Note">
  The list of supported chains depends on the wallet you are using; not all
  wallets allow you to add custom chains. Therefore, it may not be possible to
  get information for some chains.
</Callout>

```ts twoslash
import { getChain } from "@quirks/ssr";

// ---cut-start---
const quirksRawCookie = '';
// ---cut-end---

/**
 * The name of the chain for which you want to obtain information
 * corresponds to the one you have used in the Config object.
 */
const chainName = "osmosis";

const { address, accountName } = getChain(quirksRawCookie, chainName);
```

### getChains

Returns information about all connected chains. If the wallet is connected,
it will also return the address for that wallet/chain pairs.

```ts twoslash
import { getChains } from "@quirks/ssr";

// ---cut-start---
const quirksRawCookie = '';
// ---cut-end---

const { accounts, accountName, getAddresses, getAddress } = getChains(quirksRawCookie);
```

#### Example using NextJS

```tsx twoslash title="/app/server-component-example.tsx"
import { getConnect, getChain } from "@quirks/ssr";
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';
// ---cut-start---
import * as React from "react";
// ---cut-end---

export const ServerComponentExample = async () => {
  const results = await cookies();
  const quirks = results.get("quirks")?.value;

  if (!quirks) {
    return null
  }

  const { connected } = getConnect(quirks);
  const { address } = getChain(quirks, "osmosis");

  if (!connected) {
    return <div>Disconnected</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      Server Component
      <div>Chain Name: Osmosis</div>
      <div>Address: {address}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```
