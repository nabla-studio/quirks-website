title: Hooks
---

quirks provides several useful hooks for integrating the library and its functionality within a react codebase.

## useConnect

Returns the methods and information needed to operate the wallets, to be able to make the connection to them and also to have information on the status of the connection.

```ts twoslash
import { useConnect } from "@quirks/react";

const {
  connect,
  disconnect,
  status,
  setupStatus,
  connected,
  connecting,
  disconnected,
  rejected,
  wallet,
  walletName
} = useConnect();
```

## useChain

If the wallet is connected and given the name of a previously configured chain, it returns the information for that chain.

<Callout title="Note">
  The list of supported chains depends on the wallet you are using; not all
  wallets allow you to add custom chains. So sometimes it is not possible to get
  information for some chains.
</Callout>

```ts twoslash
import { useChain } from "@quirks/react";

/**
 * The name of the chain for which you want to obtain
 * information corresponds to the one you have configured in the Config object.
 */
const chainName = "osmosis";

const {
  chain,
  address,
  accountName,
  getOfflineSigner,
  getOfflineSignerOnlyAmino,
  getOfflineSignerAuto,
  signAmino,
  signDirect,
} = useChain(chainName);
```

## useChains

If the wallet is connected, it returns information about all connected chains, from which it is possible to find all connected accounts or get specific information about a chain.

<Callout title="Note">
  The list of supported chains depends on the wallet you are using; not all
  wallets allow you to add custom chains. So sometimes it is not possible to get
  information for some chains.
</Callout>

```ts twoslash
import { useChains } from "@quirks/react";

const {
  accounts,
  accountName,
  getAddresses,
  getAddress,
  getChain
} = useChains();
```

## useConfig

Returns information about the configuration of quirks, previously defined in the [Config object](/docs/config).

```ts twoslash
import { useConfig } from "@quirks/react";

const {
  wallets,
  chains,
  assetsLists
} = useConfig();
```

## useWalletConnect

Returns information about the connection with wallet connect, including also the uri for pairing when connecting to a wallet that supports it.

```ts twoslash
import { useWalletConnect } from "@quirks/react";

const {
  pairingURI,
  namespaces,
  providerOpts
} = useWalletConnect();
```

## useWalletEvents

It is a utility to allow subscription to quirks events, in order to perform custom actions.

```ts twoslash
import { useWalletEvents } from "@quirks/react";

useWalletEvents("accountsChanged", () => {
//               ^|
// your custom code
});
```
