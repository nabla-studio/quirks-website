title: Hooks
---

Quirks provides several useful hooks for integrating the library and its 
functionality within your react codebase.

## useConnect

Returns the methods and information needed to use the wallets, to connect 
to them, and to get information about the status of the connection.

```ts twoslash
import { useConnect } from "@quirks/react";

const {
  connect,
  disconnect,
  status,
  setupStatus,
  connected,
  connecting,
  disconnected,
  rejected,
  wallet,
  walletName
} = useConnect();
```

## useChain

If you use the name of a previously configured chain as parameter, it will 
return information about that chain. If the wallet is connected, it will also 
return the address for that wallet/chain pair.

<Callout title="Note">
The list of supported chains depends on the wallet you are using; not all 
wallets allow you to add custom chains. Therefore, it may not be possible to 
get information for some chains.
</Callout>

```ts twoslash
import { useChain } from "@quirks/react";

/**
 * The name of the chain for which you want to obtain information
 * corresponds to the one you have used in the Config object.
 */
const chainName = "osmosis";

const {
  chain,
  address,
  accountName,
  getOfflineSigner,
  getOfflineSignerOnlyAmino,
  getOfflineSignerAuto,
  signAmino,
  signDirect,
} = useChain(chainName);
```

## useChains

Returns information about all connected chains. If the wallet is connected, 
it will also return the address for that wallet/chain pairs.

<Callout title="Note">
The list of supported chains depends on the wallet you are using; not all 
wallets allow you to add custom chains. Therefore, it may not be possible to 
get information for some chains.
</Callout>

```ts twoslash
import { useChains } from "@quirks/react";

const {
  accounts,
  accountName,
  getAddresses,
  getAddress,
  getChain
} = useChains();
```

## useConfig

Returns information about the configuration of Quirks previously defined in the
[Config object](/docs/config).

```ts twoslash
import { useConfig } from "@quirks/react";

const {
  wallets,
  chains,
  assetsLists
} = useConfig();
```

## useWalletConnect

Returns information about Wallet Connect connection, including the
**pairing URI** if connecting to a wallet that supports it.

```ts twoslash
import { useWalletConnect } from "@quirks/react";

const {
  pairingURI,
  namespaces,
  providerOpts
} = useWalletConnect();
```

## useWalletEvents

It is a utility that allows you to subscribe to Quirks events to perform 
custom actions.

```ts twoslash
import { useWalletEvents } from "@quirks/react";

useWalletEvents("accountsChanged", () => {
//               ^|
// your custom code
});
```
