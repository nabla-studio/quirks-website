title: Configurations
description: Detailed explanation of the Quirks configuration object and its parameters.
---

As seen before, to initialise Quirks it is necessary to pass an object with a
valid configuration. Currently the library supports several configuration
parameters to customise different layers (e.g. choose the storage type, the
wallets to use, etc.).

Below is an in-depth look at all the elements that make up the
[`Config`](https://github.com/nabla-studio/quirks/blob/main/packages/store/src/types/options.ts#L26) type.

### Usage

```ts twoslash
import { type Config, ssrPersistOptions } from "@quirks/store";
import {
  keplrExtension,
  leapExtension,
  xdefiExtension,
  cosmostationExtension,
  universalWalletConnect,
} from "@quirks/wallets";
import {
  chain as osmosis,
  assets as osmosisAssetList,
} from 'chain-registry/mainnet/osmosis';

const config: Config = {
  wallets: [
    keplrExtension,
    leapExtension,
    cosmostationExtension,
    xdefiExtension,
    universalWalletConnect,
  ],
  chains: [osmosis],
  assetsLists: [osmosisAssetList],
  persistOptions: ssrPersistOptions,
  walletConnectOptions: {
    providerOpts: {
      logger: "info",
      projectId: "<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>",
      metadata: {
        name: "React App",

        icons: ["https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37784886"],
      },
    },
  },
};
```
