As seen previously, in order to initialize quirks it is necessary to pass an object with a valid configuration, currently the library supports several configuration parameters in order to customize different layers (For example, choose the type of storage, the wallets to be used, etc.).

Below we will look in detail at all the items that make up the [`Config`](https://github.com/nabla-studio/quirks/blob/main/packages/store/src/types/options.ts#L26) type.

### Usage

```ts twoslash
import { type Config, ssrPersistOptions } from "@quirks/store";
import {
  keplrExtension,
  leapExtension,
  xdefiExtension,
  cosmostationExtension,
  universalWalletConnect,
} from "@quirks/wallets";
import { osmosis, osmosisAssetList } from "@nabla-studio/chain-registry";

const config: Config = {
  wallets: [
    keplrExtension,
    leapExtension,
    cosmostationExtension,
    xdefiExtension,
    universalWalletConnect,
  ],
  chains: [osmosis],
  assetsLists: [osmosisAssetList],
  persistOptions: ssrPersistOptions,
  walletConnectOptions: {
    providerOpts: {
      logger: "info",
      projectId: "<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>",
      metadata: {
        name: "React App",
        description: "React App for WalletConnect",
        url: "https://walletconnect.com/",
        icons: ["https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37784886"],
      },
    },
  },
};
```
