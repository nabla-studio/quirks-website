As seen previously, in order to initialize quirks it is necessary to pass an object with a valid configuration, currently the library supports several configuration parameters in order to customize different layers (For example, choose the type of storage, the wallets to be used, etc.).

Below we will look in detail at all the items that make up the [`Config`](https://github.com/nabla-studio/quirks/blob/main/packages/store/src/types/options.ts#L26) type.

### Usage

```ts twoslash
import { type Config, ssrPersistOptions } from "@quirks/store";
import {
  keplrExtension,
  leapExtension,
  xdefiExtension,
  cosmostationExtension,
  universalWalletConnect,
} from "@quirks/wallets";
import { osmosis, osmosisAssetList } from "@nabla-studio/chain-registry";

const config: Config = {
  wallets: [
    keplrExtension,
    leapExtension,
    cosmostationExtension,
    xdefiExtension,
    universalWalletConnect,
  ],
  chains: [osmosis],
  assetsLists: [osmosisAssetList],
  persistOptions: ssrPersistOptions,
  walletConnectOptions: {
    providerOpts: {
      logger: "info",
      projectId: "<YOUR-PROJECT-ID>",
      metadata: {
        name: "React App",
        description: "React App for WalletConnect",
        url: "https://walletconnect.com/",
        icons: ["https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37784886"],
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Types

<TypeTable
  type={{
    wallets: {
      description:
        "Array of wallets that you intend to use, imported from @quirks/wallets.",
      type: "Wallet[]",
      default: "[]",
    },

      type: "AssetLists[]",
      default: "[]",
    },
    autoConnect: {
      description:
        "If a session with quirks was previously initialized and is present in the store then the latter is restored, this may result in the modal popup of the last connected wallet (As in the case of Keplr).",
      type: "boolean",
      default: "true",
    },
    autoSuggestions: {
      description:
        "Automatically suggest chains using the provided ones, is useful if you want to add a chain not natively supported by a wallet to it.",
      type: "boolean",
      default: "true",
    },
    signOptions: {
      description:
        "An object containing preferences to be sent to the connected wallet for sign operations.",
      type: "SignOptions",
      typeDescriptionLink: "#signoptions",
    },
    signerOptions: {
      description:
        "Allow signing and broadcasting configuration based on your needs.",
      type: "SignerOptions",
      typeDescriptionLink: "#signeroptions",
    },
    persistOptions: {
      description:
        "Configuration for persistent data, by default we use localstorage from Web API. There are also specifici setup for SSR (`ssrPersistOptions`) and React Native.",
      type: "PersistOptions<AppState>",
      typeDescriptionLink:
        "https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/integrations/persisting-store-data#options",
      default: "defaultPersistOptions",
    },
    walletConnectOptions: {
      description:
        "Required if you use wallet connect, is used to define the parameters you request from wallet connect, such as the project id.",
      type: "WalletConnectOptions",
      typeDescriptionLink: "#WalletConnectOptions",
    },
  }}
/>

- **`persistOptions: PersistOptions<AppState>`**
  - Optional
  - Default to **`defaultPersistOptions`**, by default we use localstorage from Web API, we also have a storage for SSR (**`ssrPersistOptions`**) all exported from **`@quirks/store`** package.
  - This option is very helpful if you wanna use quirks on react native for example, so you can provide a differente storage for example [react-native-mmkv](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv).
  - This config is based on [zustand middleware](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/integrations/persisting-store-data#options)
- **`walletConnectOptions: { providerOpts: UniversalProviderOpts; namespaces?: { cosmos: Omit<Namespace,'chains'> };
}`**
  - Optional
  - Required if you use wallet connect
  - Structured as follow:
    - **`providerOpts: UniversalProviderOpts`**
      - **Required**
      - It is based on the universal providers configuration of wallet connect, allows us to define the metadata of our app and customize some behaviors.
      - Structured as follow:
        - **`projectId: string`**
          - **Required**
          - Your dApp project id, you can generate it from wallet [connect dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/sign-in).
        - **`metadata?: Metadata`**
          - Optional
          - Although optional it is recommended to populate the metadata since in wallets this information is used to show the connection to the user
          - Your dApp metadata, for example dApp name, icon, description url and redirect for deeplink.
        - **`logger?: string`**
          - Optional
          - Can be:
            - **`info`**, if you wanna log wallet connect behaviour inside your console.
        - **`client?: SignClient`**
          - Optional
          - If not provided, it'll be initialized inside our worflow.
          - It's an instance of `SignClient` from `@walletconnect/sign-client`.
        - **`relayUrl?: string`**
          - Optional
          - Default to **`wss://relay.walletconnect.com`**.
          - Useful if you wanna provide a custom Relay Server URL.
        - **`storage?: IKeyValueStorage`**
          - Optional
          - Default to **`localstorage`**.
          - This option is very helpful if you wanna use quirks on react native for example, so you can provide a differente storage for example [react-native-mmkv](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv).
        - **`name?: string`**
          - Optional
          - Customize sign client name.
        - **`disableProviderPing?: boolean`**
          - Optional
          - Default to **`false`**.
    - **`namespaces?: { cosmos: Omit<Namespace, 'chains'> }`**
      - Optional
      - Default to cosmos chains setup.
      - It enable custom namespace configuration, if provided for cosmos it'll merge object data with default cosmos setup, it's useful if you wanna provide extra events, methods ecc.
      - For more details about namespace check the [official docs](https://specs.walletconnect.com/2.0/specs/clients/sign/namespaces).
