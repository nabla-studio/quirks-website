If you use quirks with the following versions of the dependencies:

- `@quirks/core` >= 0.19.0
- `@quirks/store` >= 0.27.0
- `@quirks/wallets` >= 0.19.0
- `@quirks/react` >= 0.14.3
- `@quirks/ssr` >= 0.1.3
- `@quirks/vue` >= 0.12.5
- `@quirks/nuxt` >= 0.2.27
- `@quirks/react-native` >= 0.2.24

We have deprecated the dependency [`@nabla-studio/chain-registry`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nabla-studio/chain-registry) in favor of [`chain-registry`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chain-registry), as it now features three shaking and is the library used by the community.
