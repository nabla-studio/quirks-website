description: Guide on integrating Cosmiframe support, specifically for DAODAO, into Quirks.

Since the release of [@quirks/wallets@0.17.0](https://github.com/nabla-studio/quirks/releases/tag/wallets%400.17.0),
support for [cosmiframe](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/cosmiframe) has been added, which allows a parent dapp to include daughter dapps within it, as it started on [DAODAO](https://daodao.zone/).

## DAODAO iframe Example

Integration is very simple, just import the provider for DAODAO into the configuration, as follows:

```ts twoslash
import { daodaoCosmiframe } from "@quirks/wallets";
import { createConfig, ssrPersistOptions } from "@quirks/store";
import {
  chain as osmosis,
  assets as osmosisAssetList,
} from 'chain-registry/mainnet/osmosis';

const store = createConfig({
  wallets: [
    daodaoCosmiframe,
  ],
  chains: [osmosis],
  assetsLists: [osmosisAssetList],
});
```
