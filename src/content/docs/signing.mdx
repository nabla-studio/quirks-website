description: Guide on how to use Quirks utilities for signing and broadcasting transactions.
---

As described earlier, one of the features of Quirks is its ability to let you
access its state globally, regardless of the framework you are using.

In addition, to improve the development experience, we have been working on
some features that deal with signing a transaction. For this reason we provide
you with a number of utilities within `@quirks/store`.

<Callout title="Note">
  The functions presented below, are not reactive, it is recommended to use the
  specific packages of each framework for reactive behaviors, such as
  `@quirks/react` or `@quirks/vue`
</Callout>

### getAddress

Returns the current account address by `chainName`

```ts twoslash
import { getAddress, createConfig } from "@quirks/store";

/**
* Your global store instance
*/
const store = createConfig({
  wallets: [],
  chains: [],
  assetsLists: [],
});

const chainName = "osmosis";
const address = getAddress(store, chainName);
```

### getChain

Returns chain info by `chainName`

```ts twoslash
import { getChain, createConfig } from "@quirks/store";

/**
* Your global store instance
*/
const store = createConfig({
  wallets: [],
  chains: [],
  assetsLists: [],
});

const chainName = "osmosis";
const chain = getChain(store, chainName);
```

### getOfflineSigner

Returns a valid signer class by `chainId` and `signerType` (`auto`, `amino`
or `direct`).

```ts twoslash
import { getOfflineSigner, createConfig } from "@quirks/store";

/**
* Your global store instance
*/
const store = createConfig({
  wallets: [],
  chains: [],
  assetsLists: [],
});

const chainId = "osmosis-1";
const signer = getOfflineSigner(store, chainId, "auto");
//                                        ^|
```

### getSigningStargateClient

Returns an instance of CosmJS Signing Stargate Client

```ts twoslash
import { getSigningStargateClient, createConfig } from "@quirks/store";

/**
* Your global store instance
*/
const store = createConfig({
  wallets: [],
  chains: [],
  assetsLists: [],
});

const chainName = "osmosis";
const signer = getSigningStargateClient(store, chainName, "auto");
//                                                  ^|
```

### getSigningCosmWasmClient

Returns an instance of CosmJS Signing CosmWasm Stargate Client

```ts twoslash
import { getSigningCosmWasmClient, createConfig } from "@quirks/store";

/**
* Your global store instance
*/
const store = createConfig({
  wallets: [],
  chains: [],
  assetsLists: [],
});

const chainName = "osmosis";
const signer = getSigningCosmWasmClient(store, chainName, "auto");
//                                                  ^|
```

### sign

Signs a transaction using CosmJS Stargate Client on a given `chainName`.

Allows specifying **messages**, **fees**, **signer type**, **memo**, **explicitSignerData** and **timeoutHeight**.

```ts twoslash
import { sign, createConfig } from "@quirks/store";

/**
* Your global store instance
*/
const store = createConfig({
  wallets: [],
  chains: [],
  assetsLists: [],
});

const chainName = "osmosis";
const txRaw = sign(
  store,
  chainName,
  [],
  "auto",
  "auto",
  "memo",
  {
    accountNumber: 0,
    sequence: 0,
    chainId: "",
  },
  BigInt(0),
);
```

### signCW

Signs a CosmWasm transaction using CosmJS Stargate Client on a given
`chainName`.

Allows specifying **messages**, **fees**, **signer type**, **memo**, **explicitSignerData** and **timeoutHeight**.

```ts twoslash
import { signCW, createConfig } from "@quirks/store";

/**
* Your global store instance
*/
const store = createConfig({
  wallets: [],
  chains: [],
  assetsLists: [],
});

const chainName = "osmosis";
const txRaw = signCW(
  store,
  chainName,
  [],
  "auto",
  "auto",
  "memo",
  {
    accountNumber: 0,
    sequence: 0,
    chainId: "",
  },
  BigInt(0),
);
```

### signArbitrary

Signs an arbitrary message using the wallet on a given `chainId`. Allows
specifying the **signer** and **message data**. (Useful for use cases such
as auth token generation).

```ts twoslash
import { signArbitrary, getAddress, createConfig } from "@quirks/store";

/**
* Your global store instance
*/
const store = createConfig({
  wallets: [],
  chains: [],
  assetsLists: [],
});

const chainName = "osmosis";
const chainId = "osmosis-1";
const address = await getAddress(store, chainName);
const signature = signArbitrary(store, chainId, address, "string to sign");
```

### broadcast

Broadcasts a `TxRaw` transaction on a given `chainName`. Optional parameters
allow specifying **timeout** and **poll interval**.

```ts twoslash
import { sign, broadcast, createConfig } from "@quirks/store";

/**
* Your global store instance
*/
const store = createConfig({
  wallets: [],
  chains: [],
  assetsLists: [],
});
const chainName = "osmosis";
const txRaw = await sign(store, chainName, [], "auto", "auto", undefined);
const txResponse = await broadcast(store, chainName, txRaw, 60_000, 3_000);
```

### broadcastSync

Broadcasts a `TxRaw` transaction synchronously on a given `chainName`.  
It returns the hash of the transaction (no waiting through polling).
It's useful for use cases where you want to trace the tx using some other
method, such as websocket or state machines.

```ts twoslash
import { sign, broadcastSync, createConfig } from "@quirks/store";

/**
* Your global store instance
*/
const store = createConfig({
  wallets: [],
  chains: [],
  assetsLists: [],
});
const chainName = "osmosis";
const txRaw = await sign(store, chainName, [], "auto", "auto", undefined);
const txResponse = await broadcastSync(store, chainName, txRaw);
```

## Sign a `send` message

In this example we want to sign a `send` message. We'll use the `osmojs` library
to compose the message, but you can use whatever library is most convenient
for you.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Install `osmojs`

    ```package-install
    osmojs
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Connect a wallet using the methods described in the "Getting Started" 
    section, based on your framework 
    ([react](/docs/getting-started/react/quick-start) or [vue](/docs/getting-started/vue/quick-start)).
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Create a `send` function. For example purposes only, we will make a 
    "self-send" to the same connected address on the Osmosis chain.

    ```ts twoslash title="send.ts"

import { sign, getAddress, broadcast, createConfig } from "@quirks/store";

/**
* Your global store instance
*/
const store = createConfig({
  wallets: [],
  chains: [],
  assetsLists: [],
});

export const send = async () => {
      const cosmos = (await import("osmojs")).cosmos;
      const { send } = cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MessageComposer.withTypeUrl;

      const address = getAddress(store, "osmosis");

      const msg = send({
        amount: [
          {
            denom: "uosmo",
            amount: "1",
          },
        ],
        toAddress: address,
        fromAddress: address,
      });

      const txRaw = await sign(store, "osmosis", [msg]);

      const res = await broadcast(store, "osmosis", txRaw);

      return res;

};

````

As you may have noticed, `osmojs` is imported using dynamic imports,
to optimise the **bundle size**.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Call the function from anywhere you want to use it.
    For example, in React, you could do something like this.

```tsx twoslash title="send-button.ts"
// @filename: send.ts
import { sign, getAddress, broadcast, createConfig } from "@quirks/store";

/**
* Your global store instance
*/
const store = createConfig({
  wallets: [],
  chains: [],
  assetsLists: [],
});

export const send = async () => {
  const cosmos = (await import("osmojs")).cosmos;
  const { send } = cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MessageComposer.withTypeUrl;

  const address = getAddress(store, "osmosis");

  const msg = send({
    amount: [
      {
        denom: "uosmo",
        amount: "1",
      },
    ],
    toAddress: address,
    fromAddress: address,
  });

  const txRaw = await sign(store, "osmosis", [msg]);

  const res = await broadcast(store, "osmosis", txRaw);

  return res;
};
// @filename: send-button.tsx
// ---cut---
import { send } from "./send";
// ---cut-start---
import * as React from "react";
// ---cut-end---

export const SendComponent = () => {
    return <button onClick={send}>Send</button>;
};
````

  </Step>
</Steps>

  To track the state of transactions and your dapp in general, we recommend
  using [tanstack query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest). New code examples
  will be provided in the future.
